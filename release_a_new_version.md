1. Delete 2 folders: [independent.egg-info](independent.egg-info), [dist](dist).

2. Choose the name of the new version with the format A.B.C.D where A, B, C and D are positive integers. Increase D by 1
   if the new version only has bag fixes and marginal changes. Increase C by 1 and set D to 0 if the new version has
   some new features, but any code writen with previous version still work. Increase B by 1 and set C and D to 0, if
   some code that was writen with the previous version may not work, but the main structure of the package is the same.
   Increase A by 1 and set B, C and D to 0, if the main structure of the package has changed and most of the code that
   was writen with the previous code does not work any longer.
